# 🧠 Skill Gap Analysis  
Web Analytics Project — Identifying Skill Gaps for Job Candidates

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to identify the gap between a user's current skill set and the skills required for the job they are targeting.  
Using **ADZUNA** to extract job postings, we aggregate and analyze the required skills for a specific role or team.  
A dashboard in **Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)** will visually present the missing skills and recommendations to help users prepare and become stronger candidates.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze user-provided skills and job preferences  
- Extract relevant job descriptions using **ADZUNA**  
- Identify skill gaps between user abilities and target job requirements  
- Provide recommendations for upskilling  
- Present results in a clear, interactive dashboard

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **ADZUNA** — Job data extraction  
- **Python** — Data cleaning, structuring, and analysis  
- **Looker Studio (Google Data Studio)** — Dashboard visualization
